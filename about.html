    hi! <br><br>
    my name is myles riesgaard, and i am a musician and student currently residing in wilmington, nc. i primarily play the bass, as well as the guitar, piano, drums, and the otamatone (not really). occasionally i freelance on the bass as well! <br><br>
    currently, i am learning how to program and otherwise dabble in computer science - this website is a testament to what i've learned thus far! i hope you enjoy your stay on my little corner of the interwebs :-)
