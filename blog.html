      <p> howdy! <br><br>
        
      i love chaos music. like soaking my brain in warm water and soap <br>
      here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

      <b>hellfire - black midi (2022)</b> <br><br>
      
      i got introduced to black midi through black country, new road's frequent collaborations with the band (see: <a class="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpegm3h79y0">black midi, new road</a>). i feel this collaboration is a fantastic idea mainly because i see the relationship of black country, new road and black midi similar to that of mario and wario, respectively. that was my take-away after listening to <i>hellfire</i> anyway - it's evil music in the best way possible. the album is just a non-stop flurry of punches, smacking you in the face with layers upon layers upon layers of instrumentation. this instrumentation can be all over the place, from punk guitar to bebop saxophone to vaudeville piano to a really sick drum solo. seriously - i implore you to look at the personnel for the album and see the ridiculous amount of instruments they used for this album. <br><br>

      this album is a LOT of fun, and it's an album that demands your utmost and entire attention for its 39 minute span. its usage of comedy also emphasizes this - i think about the ridiculous transition between the loud and fast <i>welcome to hell</i> and the cutesy country song <i>still</i>. take some time to just sit down and absorb it!! <br><br>

      favorite tracks: sugar/tzu, welcome to hell, 27 questions <br><br>

      until next time, <br>

      <p> howdy! <br><br>

        today the new gorillaz album <i>cracker island</i> was released! so naturally, here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

        <b>cracker island - gorillaz (2023)</b> <br><br>

        before even getting into the album, it's interesting to note that the singles rollout for <i>cracker island</i> began a whole SIX MONTHS before it officially came out. during this time, they released five singles out of the ten songs on the whole album. i'm typically not a fan of this kind of rollout (i feel it spoils the album), so i tried to approach my listening with as little outside knowledge of the singles as possible :) <br><br>

        onto the album! first of all, there are some great standout tracks, my favorite being the title track featuring thundercat. it is just an excellent, super catchy song that, while quite simple, keeps you captivated the entire time (and the bass!!!! yes!!!!!). i also enjoyed <i>new gold</i>, and i thought the collaboration between tame impala and bootie brown worked very well. i was also shocked by how much i enjoyed <i>tormenta</i> featuring bad bunny - the instrumentals have a great summery lullaby sound, and bad bunny's vocals add a nice shake-up that i think the album really needed. finally, i thought <i>skinny ape</i> was a a super innovative track that stood out from the rest of the songs on the album - i picked up some traces of hyperpop here as well, which i think is really cool. <br><br>

        with all that said, i can't say the rest of the album really impressed me. a lot of the other songs feel pretty uninspired, almost as if they were designed to be as radio-friendly as possible. tracks like <i>the tired influencer</i> and <i>baby queen</i> are very forgettable - directly after listening to the album i could not recall to you any standout features or even the melodies of these songs. to their defense, however, i think gorillaz faces an almost herculean task in living up to some of their previous albums like <i>demon days</i> and <i>plastic beach</i>. overall, i feel the album was an enjoyable listen, but i think i will only revisit some of the standout songs rather than the album as a whole. <br><br>

        favorite tracks: cracker island, new gold, skinny ape, tormenta <br><br>

      <p> howdy! <br><br>
        
          this week i was recommended an album to listen to :) thanks shannon! here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L - panchiko (2000)</b> <br><br>

          my first thought when i started listening to this album was about how insanely ahead of its time it was. it may just be because of its lo-fi audio production, but i would've guessed this was released in the past five years, not twenty-two. it wears the influence of radiohead pretty broadly (i hear the bends frequently in this album), however sometimes i feel it's too broad - i liked the track "sodium chloride," but it seems like a direct rip of "high and dry." it has this almost amateur-ish sound that makes it very endearing and creates a connection between itself and you, the listener. nostalgic is a one-word descriptor i would use for this album. even if you didn't necessarily grow up on the bands who influenced panchiko, you will certainly hear the themes of longing in the digital age. <br><br>

          favorite tracks: D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L, laputa, the eyes of ibad  <br><br>

          this week the 2023 grammys were hosted and some artists won some awards! on whether they deserved it or not..... uh, here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>dragon new warm mountain i believe in you - big thief (2022)</b> <br><br>

          recently i had listened to some of adrianne lenker's (the vocalist for big thief) solo work and was very impressed. a lot of it was written very well and reminded me of romantic-era poetry, but for the modern age! anyways, i decided to get big thief's new album a listen after their nomination (and subsequent SNUB!!!), and i was extremely impressed. the main theme i took away from it was that it was like a children's book come to life - allusions to mythical images like dragons atop mountains and little forest creatures only affirm this idea. it's just an album packed full of innocence, wonder, and a tinge of melancholy. i recommend listening while sitting in a little bean bag chair in the kid's section of a barnes & noble. <br><br>

          favorite tracks: simulation swarm, time escaping, blue lightning <br><br>

          we are back!!! here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>the soft bulletin - the flaming lips (1999)</b> <br><br>


          another banger from the lips!!! it has it's similarities with yoshimi battles the pink robots, but i feel this one dives into a lot more pseudo-symphonic sounds with some really excellent synthwork. the album also presents a lot of philosophical topics in its songs, like existentialism and human meaning, but it keeps the lyrics simple enough that it's accessible for everybody. highly, highly recommend! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: race for the prize, a spoonful weighs a ton, waitin' on a superman <br><br>

      <p> hello... again! <br><br>
          i thought it might be fun to write about what i've been listening to lately here! i've made it a challenge to listen to at least 1 or 2 albums i've never listened to a week this year, so here's what i listened to this week:<br><br>

          <b>yoshimi battles the pink robots - the flaming lips (2003)</b> <br><br>

          this was an amazing record - i would need to give it another listen, but i'm positive it's already in my top 10 albums ever. it's just so wonderfully weird! it manages to ping-pong between emotions of happiness and melancholy so fast that it all blends together into warm, sonic bliss. and there's lots of beep boops too! i cannot come up with another artist, album or even genre that i can compare this to. it is definitely worth your listen. rock? alt rock? indie rock? psychedelia? electronica? WHO KNOWS??? JUST LISTEN!!!<br><br>
          
          favorite tracks: fight test, yoshimi battles the pink robots (parts 1 and 2), approaching pavonis mons by balloon <br><br>

          <b>mountain rock - dear nora (2004)</b> <br><br>

          i kind of stumbled upon this record purely by happenstance - the first track got auto-added onto one of my playlists somehow? but i really enjoyed it, so i took the time to listen to the whole thing! it's a great folksy sort of record - you can tell a lot of ideas are being crammed into such a short amount of time. i think this does make the listening a bit harder, given a lot of these ideas come in the form of 1 minute songs that sound unfinished and almost grating on the ears. however, i found mountain rock to be an interesting folk album and will definitely look into more dear nora! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: the lonesome border pt. 1, hung up, love song for my friends <br><br>
