          this week i was recommended an album to listen to :) thanks shannon! here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L - panchiko (2000)</b> <br><br>

          my first thought when i started listening to this album was about how insanely ahead of its time it was. it may just be because of its lo-fi audio production, but i would've guessed this was released in the past five years, not twenty-two. it wears the influence of radiohead pretty broadly (i hear the bends frequently in this album), however sometimes i feel it's too broad - i liked the track "sodium chloride," but it seems like a direct rip of "high and dry." it has this almost amateur-ish sound that makes it very endearing and creates a connection between itself and you, the listener. nostalgic is a one-word descriptor i would use for this album. even if you didn't necessarily grow up on the bands who influenced panchiko, you will certainly hear the themes of longing in the digital age. <br><br>

          favorite tracks: D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L, laputa, the eyes of ibad  <br><br>

        until next time, <br>

          this week the 2023 grammys were hosted and some artists won some awards! on whether they deserved it or not..... uh, here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>dragon new warm mountain i believe in you - big thief (2022)</b> <br><br>

          recently i had listened to some of adrianne lenker's (the vocalist for big thief) solo work and was very impressed. a lot of it was written very well and reminded me of romantic-era poetry, but for the modern age! anyways, i decided to get big thief's new album a listen after their nomination (and subsequent SNUB!!!), and i was extremely impressed. the main theme i took away from it was that it was like a children's book come to life - allusions to mythical images like dragons atop mountains and little forest creatures only affirm this idea. it's just an album packed full of innocence, wonder, and a tinge of melancholy. i recommend listening while sitting in a little bean bag chair in the kid's section of a barnes & noble. <br><br>

          favorite tracks: simulation swarm, time escaping, blue lightning <br><br>

          we are back!!! here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>the soft bulletin - the flaming lips (1999)</b> <br><br>


          another banger from the lips!!! it has it's similarities with yoshimi battles the pink robots, but i feel this one dives into a lot more pseudo-symphonic sounds with some really excellent synthwork. the album also presents a lot of philosophical topics in its songs, like existentialism and human meaning, but it keeps the lyrics simple enough that it's accessible for everybody. highly, highly recommend! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: race for the prize, a spoonful weighs a ton, waitin' on a superman <br><br>

      <p> hello... again! <br><br>
          i thought it might be fun to write about what i've been listening to lately here! i've made it a challenge to listen to at least 1 or 2 albums i've never listened to a week this year, so here's what i listened to this week:<br><br>

          <b>yoshimi battles the pink robots - the flaming lips (2003)</b> <br><br>

          this was an amazing record - i would need to give it another listen, but i'm positive it's already in my top 10 albums ever. it's just so wonderfully weird! it manages to ping-pong between emotions of happiness and melancholy so fast that it all blends together into warm, sonic bliss. and there's lots of beep boops too! i cannot come up with another artist, album or even genre that i can compare this to. it is definitely worth your listen. rock? alt rock? indie rock? psychedelia? electronica? WHO KNOWS??? JUST LISTEN!!!<br><br>
          
          favorite tracks: fight test, yoshimi battles the pink robots (parts 1 and 2), approaching pavonis mons by balloon <br><br>

          <b>mountain rock - dear nora (2004)</b> <br><br>

          i kind of stumbled upon this record purely by happenstance - the first track got auto-added onto one of my playlists somehow? but i really enjoyed it, so i took the time to listen to the whole thing! it's a great folksy sort of record - you can tell a lot of ideas are being crammed into such a short amount of time. i think this does make the listening a bit harder, given a lot of these ideas come in the form of 1 minute songs that sound unfinished and almost grating on the ears. however, i found mountain rock to be an interesting folk album and will definitely look into more dear nora! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: the lonesome border pt. 1, hung up, love song for my friends <br><br>
