      <p> howdy! <br><br>
        
          we are back!!! here's what i listened to this week: <br><br>

          <b>the soft bulletin - the flaming lips (1999)</b> <br><br>


          another banger from the lips!!! it has it's similarities with yoshimi battles the pink robots, but i feel this one dives into a lot more pseudo-symphonic sounds with some really excellent synthwork. the album also presents a lot of philosophical topics in its songs, like existentialism and human meaning, but it keeps the lyrics simple enough that it's accessible for everybody. highly, highly recommend! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: race for the prize, a spoonful weighs a ton, waitin' on a superman <br><br>

        until next time, <br>

      <p> hello... again! <br><br>
          i thought it might be fun to write about what i've been listening to lately here! i've made it a challenge to listen to at least 1 or 2 albums i've never listened to a week this year, so here's what i listened to this week:<br><br>

          <b>yoshimi battles the pink robots - the flaming lips (2003)</b> <br><br>

          this was an amazing record - i would need to give it another listen, but i'm positive it's already in my top 10 albums ever. it's just so wonderfully weird! it manages to ping-pong between emotions of happiness and melancholy so fast that it all blends together into warm, sonic bliss. and there's lots of beep boops too! i cannot come up with another artist, album or even genre that i can compare this to. it is definitely worth your listen. rock? alt rock? indie rock? psychedelia? electronica? WHO KNOWS??? JUST LISTEN!!!<br><br>
          
          favorite tracks: fight test, yoshimi battles the pink robots (parts 1 and 2), approaching pavonis mons by balloon <br><br>

          <b>mountain rock - dear nora (2004)</b> <br><br>

          i kind of stumbled upon this record purely by happenstance - the first track got auto-added onto one of my playlists somehow? but i really enjoyed it, so i took the time to listen to the whole thing! it's a great folksy sort of record - you can tell a lot of ideas are being crammed into such a short amount of time. i think this does make the listening a bit harder, given a lot of these ideas come in the form of 1 minute songs that sound unfinished and almost grating on the ears. however, i found mountain rock to be an interesting folk album and will definitely look into more dear nora! <br><br>

          favorite tracks: the lonesome border pt. 1, hung up, love song for my friends <br><br>

        <p> hello! <br><br>
